%% We've got a separate test for capability negotiation and other mechanisms, so the test here is fairly
%% straightforward: get a list of different versions of nodes and join them into a cluster, making sure that
%% each time our data has been replicated:
confirm() ->
    NTestItems    = 1000,                                   %% How many test items to write/verify?
    NTestNodes    = 3,                                      %% How many nodes to spin up for tests?
    TestMode      = false,                                  %% Set to false for "production tests", true if too slow.
